# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Project Assignment

Welcome to your **Personal Portfolio Project**! This assignment is designed to help you practice core GitHub and project management skills, including milestones, issues, project boards, branching, commit conventions, pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts.

---

## 📌 Project Management Guidelines

### ✅ Milestones
Define major phases or deliverables of your portfolio (e.g., Landing Page, Team Profiles, Admin Panel).

### ✅ Issues
Break each milestone into manageable tasks. Link these issues to their related milestone for better tracking.

### ✅ Project Board
Create a GitHub project board with columns like:
- `To Do`
- `In Progress`
- `Done`

Assign tasks and pull requests to the appropriate columns.

---

## 🔧 Git Workflow

### 🔀 Branching
Use feature branches for each issue. Adopt a consistent naming format such as:

```
feature/<issue-number>-short-description
```

### 💬 Commits
Use structured, meaningful commit messages:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short description>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Commit Types: `(use at least 6 of these)`**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, white space, etc.
- `refactor`: Code restructure (no feature or bug)
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Test-related updates
- `chore`: Non-code updates (e.g., config)
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes
- `ci`: Continuous integration changes

**Example:**
```

Closes #45
