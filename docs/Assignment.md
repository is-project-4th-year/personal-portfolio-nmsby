## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes ðŸ˜…).
For each one, mention:

What you thought it would be like **(Expectation ðŸ‘€)**

What you actually learned **(Reality ðŸ˜…)**

And how it helped with your personal portfolio project ðŸ’»

make it honestâ€”and if it surprised you, even better!

Example format:

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought branching was just for developers working on big appsâ€”nothing Iâ€™d need for a small project.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out even solo devs need branches! It helped me avoid breaking my main code while testing new designs.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I created a feature branch for my "About Me" section and merged it smoothly into the main branch after testing. Super useful!

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
